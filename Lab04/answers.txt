======	Câu 1 (9. Constructors of whole classes and parent classes)
Which classes are aggregates of other classes?

------	Answer
- Aggregate of CompactDisc: Track
- Aggregate of Cart & Store: Media

======	Câu 2 (10. Unique item in a list)
If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?

------	Trả lời
Nếu object không phải là instance của Media thì sẽ bị lỗi run-time (ClassCastException). Vì vậy cần dùng hàm instanceof để kiểm tra object có phải là instance của Media hay không.

======	Câu 3 (12. Sort media in the cart)
Alternatively, to compare items in the cart, instead of using Comparator, we can use the Comparable interface and override the compareTo()method. You can refer to the Java docs to see the information of this interface. 
Suppose we are taking this Comparable interface approach.
-	What class should implement the Comparable interface?
-	In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method be to reflect the ordering that we want?
-	Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?
-	Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
